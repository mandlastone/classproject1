#Branches 

##What is branching
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make commits, youâ€™re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.


##Why is it used
What happens if you create a new branch? Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around. 

##When you're done push ..
git push remote origin alex_podeanu
